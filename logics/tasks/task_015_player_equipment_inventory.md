- [ ] 5. Add equipment recipes and item definitions (crafting-only in v1).
- [ ] 6. Generate/assign assets for equipment items and slot icons (if needed).
- [ ] 7. Build a dedicated Equipment panel for viewing/equipping items (empty slot labels/icons).
- [ ] 8. Add tests for equip validation, persistence, and UI behavior.
- [ ] 9. Run lint/tests and update backlog/task docs.
- [ ] FINAL: Confirm acceptance criteria and progress for item 015.
