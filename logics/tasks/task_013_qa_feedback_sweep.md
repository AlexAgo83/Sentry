# Context
This task executes `item_013_qa_feedback_sweep`.

# Plan
- [ ] 1. Roster + System entry: remove the roster Inventory button and make the version badge the only System entry (inline SVG gear icon, subtle button styling, hover + pointer).
- [ ] 2. Action panel: move the ACT control into the Action panel header (right-aligned) and rename it to "Change action" using existing button styles.
- [ ] 3. Stats panel: move the SET control into the Stats panel header (right-aligned) and rename it to "Rename hero" using existing button styles.
- [ ] 4. Offline recap: add a compact time-away formatter (`Xs`, `Xm Ys`, `Xh Ym`) and use it in the recap.
- [ ] 5. Inventory UI spacing: add 12px desktop spacing between Sort label and Name/Count controls, and between Search label and input.
- [ ] 6. Pagination: remove the pagination row from the DOM when there is only one page.
- [ ] 7. Update/extend tests to cover the moved controls, version badge click, and pagination hiding.
- [ ] 8. Run lint/tests and validate UI manually on desktop.
- [ ] FINAL: Update backlog/task docs and confirm acceptance criteria.
