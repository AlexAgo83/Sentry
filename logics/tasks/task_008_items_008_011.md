# Context
This task executes `item_008_runtime_resilience`, `item_009_ui_quality_sweep`,
`item_010_app_architecture_refactor`, and `item_011_inventory_scaling`.

# Goal
Improve runtime resilience, UI quality/perf, app architecture, and inventory scalability
without changing gameplay behavior.

# Plan
- [x] 1. Runtime resilience: real elapsed delta, clamp/cap catch-up, persistence throttling,
      storage error handling, and tests for delayed ticks + quota failures.
- [x] 2. App architecture: extract major panels into components, memoize derived data/props,
      keep behavior identical, and add per-panel render/interaction tests.
- [x] 3. UI quality sweep: accessibility (focus-visible, tap targets, labels), refactor UI
      metadata modules, optimize SVG usage, and add UI tests for usage labels/focus styles.
- [x] 4. Inventory scaling: add pagination (page size 36), persist selection across pages,
      keep focus panel accurate with off-page hint, and handle empty/no-results states.
- [x] FINAL: Validate acceptance, update docs/backlog/task status, and verify performance.

# Acceptance
- Runtime ticks match real elapsed time with bounded catch-up, and persistence failures
  do not break the runtime loop.
- UI elements meet accessibility targets and inventory usage labels remain readable.
- `App.tsx` is split into panels with reduced re-renders and unchanged behavior.
- Inventory remains responsive with 200+ items, selection persists across pages, and
  off-page selection hints are visible.
