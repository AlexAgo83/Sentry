# Needs
- Produce a global review of the project (code + Logics docs) with actionable quality recommendations.
- Identify structural hot spots (large files, coupling, missing boundaries) and propose refactors.
- Highlight test gaps / risky areas and suggest improvements to coverage and CI checks.
- Propose a short list of potential evolution tracks (next 2–4 meaningful upgrades).
- Keep recommendations scoped and prioritized for a single engineer to act on.

# Context
- Requested as a global health check of the repo and its Logics workflow.
- Prefer outputs as lightweight artifacts in `logics/` (review and optional roadmap).
- No feature implementation in this request; only analysis + recommendations.

# Backlog
- `logics/backlog/item_048_code_quality_review_and_evolution.md`
